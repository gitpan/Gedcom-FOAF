NAME
    Gedcom::FOAF - Output FOAF files from Gedcom individuals and families

SYNOPSIS
        use Gedcom;
        use Gedcom::FOAF;
    
        my $gedcom = Gedcom->new( gedcom_file => 'myfamily.ged' );
        my $i = $gedcom->get_individual( 'Butch Cassidy' );
    
        # print the individual's FOAF
        print $i->as_foaf;
    
        my( $f ) = $i->famc;
    
        # print the individual's family's (as a child) FOAF
        print $f->as_foaf;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides "as_foaf" methods to individual and family records.
    The resulting files can be parsed and crawled (scuttered) by any code
    that understands the FOAF and RDF specs.

METHODS
  Gedcom::Individual
   as_foaf( $baseurl )
    Generates a FOAF (XML) string from the Gedcom::Individual object. Pass
    in a base url if desired.

   label_name
    Generates a string suitable for an "foaf:name" element.

  Gedcom::Family
   as_foaf( $baseurl )
    Generates a FOAF (XML) string from the Gedcom::Family object. Pass in a
    base url if desired.
